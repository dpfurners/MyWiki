This narrative tells the story behind my personal website—a space where I share my projects and ideas, and a glimpse of my journey for future opportunities. Every element was carefully chosen to represent who I am and what I do, all powered by the magic of automation and creative design.

# Hugo - The World’s Fastest Framework for Building Websites

I always dreamed of having a webpage that not only showcased my work but also served as a portfolio for potential employers. Hugo, renowned for its blazing speed and simplicity, turned that dream into reality.

## How Did I Get to Hugo and Gokarna?

My journey began back in school when I learned Python, setting me firmly on the path of backend development. However, design was never my forte, and I longed for a tool that could effortlessly convert plain text into a visually appealing site. After scouring the web, I came across an insightful Reddit post: [How did you create your personal website?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ilmoae/how_did_you_create_your_personal_website/)

It was in one of the comments that I first heard about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Intrigued by its capabilities, I delved deeper and discovered [Gokarna](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/gokarna/), a beautifully simple theme perfect for a personal portfolio.

Every step of this journey has been a blend of exploration, learning, and creativity—resulting in a site that is both functional and reflective of my personal style. And thanks to the seamless integration with [wiki.js](https://wiki.dpfurner.xyz), my posts are fetched automatically, keeping the content fresh and dynamic.
